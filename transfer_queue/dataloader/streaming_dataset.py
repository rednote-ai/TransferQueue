                - controller.controller_info: ZMQServerInfo for the TransferQueueController
                - backend.storage_backend: Storage backend type (e.g., "SimpleStorage")
                - Other backend-specific configuration
            batch_size: Batch size for data loading per iter.
            micro_batch_size: Number of samples per micro-batch. This is the batch size
                that will be requested from TransferQueue for each iteration.
            data_fields: List of field names to retrieve from storage. Only these
                fields will be included in the returned batch.
            partition_id: Partition ID for data versioning. Different partitions can
                be used for different data versions or splits (e.g., "train", "val").
            task_name: Unique identifier for the training task. This is used to track
                which samples have been consumed by which task.
            dp_rank: The group ID of the current data group. All
                ranks with the same dp_rank will receive identical samples.
            should_check_consumption_status: Whether to check the consumption status of the
                partition to decide when to stop iterating. Defaults to ``False``, which
                means the iterator runs as an **infinite stream** — it will continuously
                poll for new data and never exit on its own. This is the typical mode for
                online/streaming training where producers keep feeding data indefinitely.
                Set to ``True`` when the total number of samples is known in advance (i.e.
                finite-dataset mode); the iterator will then stop once all samples in the
                partition have been consumed.

                If None, uses default_fetch_batch_fn function.
