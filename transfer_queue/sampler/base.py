class BaseSampler(ABC):
    """Base class for samplers that control how data is consumed from TransferQueue.

    A sampler defines the logic for selecting which samples to retrieve from the
    available samples, and which should be labeled as consumed (will never be retrieved in the future).
    Based on this abstraction, users can implement various data consumption strategies
    for different training scenarios, such as sequential sampling, grouped sampling for
    reinforcement learning, or custom sampling patterns.

    The sampler interface provides a clean separation between data production status
    (handled by TransferQueueController) and data consumption strategy (implemented by samplers).
    This allows users to customize data consumption behavior without modifying the TransferQueue codes.

    Available Samplers:
    - **SequentialSampler**: Default sampler, selects samples sequentially without replacement
    - **GRPOGroupNSampler**: A sampler that performs sampling on continuous N samples only when all of them are ready.
                            It assumes the N samples associated with the same prompt are stored contiguously
    - **RankAwareSampler**: Rank-aware sampling for distributed training where each rank retrieves data independently.
                            This sampler will guarantee ranks of the same DP group consume identical samples.

    NOTE: Always return both sampled and consumed indexes (may be identical).
